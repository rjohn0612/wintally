nothing much to tell!  I wanted to learn how to code and this is my first app and the only thing I could think of making.

It's a 1 vs 1 score keeper. Great for games such as Chess, Checkers, Tic Tac Toe or a vast variety of 1 on 1 Card Games.  Also designed with fighting video games in mind it can be used as a tool to record offline sessions against your toughest opponents.  

We live in a digital world now so who has time to look for pen and paper when you can just use an app! 

It doesn't have many features other than saving all records created to localStorage.

Instructions are very straight forward.  Simply fill in the fields with the name of the players as instructed, characters(if you are playing a fighting video game) and the name of the game.  As you play, record your wins and losses using the corresponding buttons.  When you are done hit the stop button and your scores are automatically saved to localStorage.  Results can be viewed on the stats page.
