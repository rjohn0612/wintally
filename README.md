nothing much to tell!  I wanted to learn how to code and this is my first app and the only thing I could think of making.

It's simply a 1vs1 score keeper for games that don't have one.  

I original made this for a fighting video game that didn't have such a simple functionality but I did my best to make it in a way where it could be used for pretty much anything.

It doesn't have many features other than saving all records created to localStorage.

Instructions are straight forward.  Simply fill in the fields with the name of the players as instructed, characters(if you are playing a fighting video game) and the name of the game.  As you play, record your wins and losses using the corresponding buttons.  When you are done hit the stop button and your scores are automatically saved to localStorage.  Results can be viewed on the stats page.
